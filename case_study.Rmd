```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(tidyverse)
data(nyc_airbnb)
```

## Get the Data

```{r}
nyc_library = nyc_airbnb |>
  rename(borough = neighbourhood_group) |>
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2)
```

## brainstorming questions

- Where are airbnbs expensive?
  - Borough? Neighborhood?
  - Do other factors (room type) affect price? What about rating?
- How long are Airbnbs active?
  - Are Airbnbs illegal and do they get shut down?
  - Which units have the most availability?
- How does review score impacted by location?
- Where are airbnbs?
  - Borough? Neighborhood?
  - Lat and Long?
